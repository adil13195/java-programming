    /*
    Create a method that will accept a String and returns the sum of all the numbers in the String.

Requirement: any numbers that are next to each other are not single digit numbers but instead read as a full number
	Ex: a5bc12def100g
		Here we would have added 5 + 12 + 100
		NOT: 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0
